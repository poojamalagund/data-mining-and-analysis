# ENERGY PREDICTION FROM SMART METER DATA
Link to the Challenge --> [IEEE-CIS TECHNICAL CHALLENGE ON ENERGY PREDICTION FROM SMART METER DATA](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/ieee-cis-technical-challenge-energy-prediction-smart-meter-data)

Instructions to run the IPYNB file:

1. The required dataset can be downloaded from the link to the challenge and should be placed in a folder named data in the same working directory.<br>
	path to consumption.csv --> 'data/consumption.csv'<br>
	path to addInfo.csv     --> 'data/addInfo.csv'<br>
	path to weather-min.csv --> 'data/weather-min.csv'<br>
	path to weather-max.csv --> 'data/weather-max.csv'<br>
	path to weather-avg.csv --> 'data/weather-avg.csv'<br>
2. The predictions made by the learning models are also saved in the data folder. 
3. Run the IPYNB file on a computer with python3 installed and the following external libraries pre-installed: <br>
	numpy <br>
	pandas<br>
	matplotlib<br>
	statsmodels<br>
	pmdarima<br>
	fbprophet<br>
<br>
